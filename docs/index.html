subtitle: Make any Bulma element collapsible with ease
---

<p>This components as been developped as a <a href="https://bulma.io" target="_blank">Bulma</a> extension and bring you the ability to <strong>easily Collapse/Exand any kind of element/component</strong>.<br />We designed it to be as generic as possible, that's why its Sass part is lighter than in its ancestor (Wikiki's bulma-accordion component). But don't worry you can still use it for accordion purpose - and even more.</p>

	<a href="{{ site.url }}/installation" class="button is-primary">Get Started</a>
	<a href="{{ site.url }}/usage" class="button">Live demo</a>

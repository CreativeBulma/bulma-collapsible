# Introduction
**Make any Bulma element collapsible with ease**

This components as been developped as a [Bulma](https://bulma.io) extension and bring you the ability to **easily Collapse/Exand any kind of element/component**.  
We designed it to be as generic as possible, that's why its Sass part is lighter than in its ancestor (Wikiki's bulma-accordion component). But don't worry you can still use it for accordion purpose - and even more.
